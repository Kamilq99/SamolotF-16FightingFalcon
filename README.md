# HTML and CSS Project Portfolio

## Project Description

This project was created to practice my HTML and CSS skills. The main goal was to develop my skills in creating responsive and aesthetic web interfaces.

After two years since its original creation, I decided to return to this project to continue its development. With this project, I would like to start building my portfolio on GitHub, showcasing my front-end skills.

## Project Content

The project contains basic HTML structures and CSS styles that were used to create a simple user interface. I also included free images from Pixabay to enrich its content and visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Image License
